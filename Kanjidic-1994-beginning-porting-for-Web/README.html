Here are the sources (written in quite a haste with Franz Lisp
and neither very well documented nor beatiful) for the beginning
of the new Web-version of Kanjidic. Kanji and kana-characters
    are shown by using a separate CGI-script called nph-jg
   (the source is in nph-jg.c) inside IMG tags, which should
    in turn (given the decimal JIS-index of the character as
    an argument) fetch the corresponding small GIF-file from 
    an almost megabyte size file called jis24x24.mug, which is
   just a concatenation of
   seven thousand or so separate GIF-files for JIS level 1 & 2
   characters. (Quite stupidly, the standard n-byte header of each
   GIF is reduplicated equally many times.)
   <P>
   This <A HREF="jis24x24.mug">jis24x24.mug</A> file was created from the
    font file called <A HREF="jis24.fnt">jis24.fnt</A>
   with the script <A HREF="DoIt">DoIt</A> and C program
   <A HREF="DoIndex.c">DoIndex.c</A>. jis24fnt was just
   a file concatenated from two (JIS levels 1 & 2) font-files,
   with 24x24 pixel bit-mapped fonts, I once adopted from a
   PD-program (whose name I don't remember anymore).

<DD>Incomplete sources (in ZIP <A HREF="kanjidic/sources.zip">kanjidic/sources.zip</A>
for the original MS-DOS version written in C can be found from here.
<A HREF="kanjidic/2newest.kd">kanjidic/2newest.kd</A> contains
the database in Lisp-list format (it was used also by the Franz-Lisp Web-version)
and some documentation about the format can be found from

<DD>Some miscellaneous Japanese-language related stuff & software.
   Note that I am not really cognisant in the Japanese language, as I
   have been more interested about the writing system per se.

PS. Sorry for hasty editing. The connection from Wales to Finland
is a little bit too low for using emacs...
